# Fire-Donor
Contains Fire Donor, a food donation application that liks people having excess of food with organisations in need of food donations.

## How it works
You create an account (pretty standard these days) which allows you access to different donors who donate food items and foodstuffs through
the app. Donation information such as product weight, name, description and such is listed on each food donation listing.
You can then request for a donated item to be delivered to your organisation storage facility or any location of choice.

## Prequisities
- A mobile smartphone.
- A stable internet connection.
- A extremely high end computer.
- A heart of gold.

## Instructions.
Make sure you have all the necessary details about the organisation you represent, including: emails, locations, names and such. The app as of this
date(Sep 08, 2019) is in its development but will be released as soon as all the requirements and logic is implemented. The app is not intended for
commercialization but is a non-profit venture.
